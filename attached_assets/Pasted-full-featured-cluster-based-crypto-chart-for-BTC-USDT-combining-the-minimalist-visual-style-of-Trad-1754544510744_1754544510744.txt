full-featured cluster-based crypto chart for BTC/USDT, combining the minimalist visual style of TradingView with the cluster-level detail of ClusterBTC.

üé® Visual Style:
- Clean, minimalist interface with a white background (no grid lines)
- Candles should be thin and update in real-time
- No "Connected" or "Last Update" indicators
- No "Auto-scroll" menu item
- All containers (left, right, bottom) should be compact and unobtrusive

üìä Candlestick & Cluster Visualization:
- Each candle (OHLC) is displayed on the left
- To the right of each candle, show multiple cluster rectangles stacked vertically
- Each cluster represents a price range (e.g. 10px height = price interval)
- Cluster rectangles span the full height of the candle
- Rectangle **width or height** reflects trade volume
- Rectangle **color** reflects delta:
  - Green = buy-dominant
  - Red = sell-dominant
  - Color intensity = percentage delta
- The **largest volume cluster** on each candle should have a thin white border
- Clusters should also appear on candle wicks (tails), not just the body

üìà Left Side: Volume Profile
- Horizontal bars showing historical volume at each price level
- Direction: left to right
- Bar length = volume size
- Hovering shows exact volume at price
- Should reflect historical accumulation zones with varying bar sizes

üìâ Bottom: Volume Histogram
- Bars aligned directly under each candle
- Bar width = candle width
- Bar height = total volume
- Bar color = visual delta (green for buy, red for sell)
- Border color = matches candle color (green/red)
- Hovering shows bid/ask breakdown and delta

üìä Right Side: Live Order Book
- Restore previous order book container on the right
- Prices aligned with chart price levels
- Horizontal red/green lines show bid/ask volumes
- Direction: right to left
- Hovering shows live bid/ask volume at price

üñ±Ô∏è Hover Interactivity:
- Show crosshair (like TradingView)
- On hover, display:
  - Current price
  - Volume at hovered price (left)
  - Volume of hovered candle (bottom)
  - Cluster data: volume, delta, bid/ask breakdown
  - Highlight hovered cluster with border

‚öôÔ∏è Behavior & Functionality:
- Real-time candle updates
- Cluster rectangles update live
- Smooth animations for zooming, panning, and data updates
- Drag-to-pan, scroll to zoom (horizontal and vertical)
- No auto-scroll unless explicitly enabled
- Responsive layout for all screen sizes

üì¶ Technologies:
- React + TypeScript
- WebSocket for live data
- Modular components:
  - CandleChart
  - ClusterOverlay
  - VolumeProfile
